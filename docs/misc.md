Demonstates the Alarm C API functionality

## DBDRIVE (Windows, IBM i)
Implements a driver DLL that allows Domino or Notes to access data in non-Domino databases using the functions @DbLookup and @DbColumn

## EDITFAX (Windows)
Demonstates the usage of the editfax APIs.

## ENCRYPT (Windows,IBM i)
Demonstrates how to write encryption enabled fields as well as how to read and store encrypted documents in a database, using secret and public encryption keys.

## EXTCONF (Windows, IBM i)
Implements an extension manager that handles replication conflicts

## EXTMNGR (Windows, IBM i)
Implements an extension manager that transforms an existing non-Domino database into a Domino database at Domino database creation time

## EXTPWD (Windows, AIX, Linux RedHat, IBM i)
Demonstrates using the Extension Manager to replace the password dialog

## FILEATT (Windows, AIX, IBM i, Linux RedHat)
Creates a document with file attachments with no corresponding hotspots

## FTSEARCH (Windows, IBM i, Linux)
Demonstrates full-text searching capabilities

## GETMULTNOTEINFO (Windows, Windows 64-bit, AIX 32-bit, AIX 64-bit Linux Suse 32bit, IBM i, Linux)
Shows the basic usage of NSFDbGetMultNoteInfo & NSFDbGetMultNoteInfoByUNID.

## IDBACKUP (Windows, IBM i)
Demonstrates Notes ID backup and recovery

## IDTABLES ( Windows, IBM i, Linux)
Shows how to use ID Tables for various operations with note IDs. also demonstrates operations between the tables.
(ID tables are an efficient method for processing a large set of notes at once.)

## ITEMMISC ( Windows, Linux)
This program changes an item value in a document and then copies the item to another document in the same view and renames it. It also checks that the documents in the view have a $Readers field

## NIF (Windows, Linux)
Demonstrates the usage of Notes Indexing Facility (NIF) related API calls. Checks whether the view in a database is time-varying,adds a document and checks whetherthe collection is up-to-date, and the note ID is in the view,read view entries and data associated with them, gets the last modified time of the database. It alsogets view rebuild directorypath.

## NOTECWF (Windows, IBM i, Linux)
Demonstrates NSFNoteComputeWithForm C API function and validation error callback function

## NOTESFLO (Windows)
Demonstrates Notes Field Exchange (Notes/FX) and NotesFlow in a COM/OLE 2 program

## NSF_DUMP (Windows, AIX, Linux RedHat, IBM i)
Displays the contents of a database file

## RESPONSE (Windows, Linux)
Creates and reads the response documents. It also updates the change in unread documents to the remote server.

## SCHEDULE(Windows,IBM i, Linux)
Demonstrates adding appointments and meeting invitations to a User's schedule as well as deleting the scheduled events and retrieving busy/free time information

## UNREAD (Windows, AIX, Linux RedHat, IBM i)
Demonstrates obtaining and modifying a table of unread notes for a user in a database file

## USER_DEF (Windows, AIX, Linux RedHat, IBM i)
Shows how to create and read fields with user-defined data types
(These fields are useful for storing special objects of your own creation, such as new kinds of graphics, data encrypted with your own scheme, and so on.)

## XML\EXPORT (Windows, IBM i)
Illustrates the DXL Export functionality for exporting Domino/Notes data into XML format.

## XML\IMPORT (Windows, IBM i, Linux)
Illustrates the DXL Import functionality for importing XML data into Domino/Notes data.

## ARCHSVC\ARCHEXP (Windows, AIX, Linux RedHat, IBM i)
Illustrates the archive export functionality for export a data note from db into output file.

## ARCHSVC\ARCHIMP (Windows, AIX, Linux RedHat, IBM i)
Illustrates the archive import functionality for import the archived file to the specified note and restore the note back to the db.
