## ALLFLDS (Windows, AIX, Linux RedHat, IBM i)
Finds all the fields in all the documents in a database

## CAPIERR (Windows)
Shows how to load an error message string given a Domino or Notes error code, from a Windows MFC C++ application.

## COPYDB (Windows, AIX, Linux RedHat, IBM i)
Copies all the components of one database to another

## CPNOTES (Windows, AIX, Linux RedHat, IBM i)
Selectively copies documents from one database to another based on various criteria, including modification time

## DBPROPS (Windows, IBM i, Linux)
Shows how to get and set some of the database properties available to the HCL C API.

## GETBUILD (Windows, AIX, Linux RedHat, IBM i)
Shows how to get the major build number identifying the version of Domino or Notes installed

## INTRO (Windows, AIX, Linux RedHat, IBM i)
Shows the basic structure of a character-mode HCL C API program, as well as how to access a database that is on a remote HCL Domino Server. Uses main as the main entry point.

## INTROWIN (Windows)
Shows the basic structure of a Windows application that makes HCL C API calls

## MSIMPLE (Windows, AIX, Linux RedHat, IBM i)
Modifies fields with simple data types

## NOTESMAIN (Windows, AIX, IBM i, Linux RedHat, )
Shows the basic structure of a character-mode HCL C API program, as well as how to access a database that is on a remote HCL Domino Server. Uses NotesMain as the main entry point.

## NUMLIST (Windows, AIX, Linux RedHat, IBM i)
Writes a field of type number list

## RSIMPLE (Windows, AIX, Linux RedHat, IBM i)
Reads fields with simple data types
(This sample demonstrates a basic sequential search of a database.)

## SRCH_ALL (Windows, AIX, Linux RedHat, IBM i)
Search for and process all documents in a database
(This sample shows how to guarantee that each document is only processed once during a sequential search.)

## SUMMARY (Windows, AIX, Linux RedHat, IBM i)
Finds and prints all summary data of all data notes in a database, without opening the data notes

## WSIMPLE (Windows, AIX, Linux RedHat, IBM i)
