PROGRAM
-------------
nsfquery.c - To test the NSFQueryDBExt2 API.

PURPOSE       
-------------   
This program writes the queries to a file, extracts the query from 
the file to query the database using NSFQueryDBExt2 and then deletes the file.

NSFQueryDBExt2 runs Domino Query Language (DQL) queries.  Its inputs are a 
database handle, the query text, length of query text, and a set of flags. 
Returns explanation of output and extra error output. The query text must be translated 
into LMBCS prior to execution.

ENVIRONMENTS
--------------------
Windows (64-bit)
Linux 64 bit

FILES
-----
nsfquery.c  - Main program.

mswin64.mak     - Makefile for Windows 64-bit.

RUNNING nsfquery
---------------------
This sample program can be run against the Domino database simple.nsf,
provided with the HCL C API for Domino and Notes toolkit.  Copy this file
to the Domino Data directory before running this program.

- Under Windows or UNIX (AIX, Linux),
  type the following at the system command prompt:

        nsfquery <database filename>
                 or
        nsfquery

  where:

  <database filename> is the filename of the Domino database.
  If no command line arguments are provided, the program will prompt for them.
