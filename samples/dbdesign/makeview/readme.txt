RUNNING makeview
----------------
This program opens the Domino database makeview.nsf. The API kit provides
this database in the notedata directory. You must copy this file to the 
Domino or Notes data directory before running makeview.

- Under Windows, or UNIX (AIX, Linux ),
  type the following at the system command prompt:

       makeview

  The program takes no arguments.


- Under IBM i type:
    rundomcmd server(<server name>) cmd(call pgm(qntcsdk/makeview))
        batch(*no)
To verify that the program ran successfully, use Notes to open the 
MakeView test database. The default view is "Simple View". The view
created by this sample program is "Test View".  Use the View menu
to select the Test View.
