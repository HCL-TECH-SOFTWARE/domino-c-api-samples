RUNNING msimple
---------------
- Under Windows or UNIX (AIX, and Linux),
  type the following at the system command prompt:
  
        msimple  <database filename>       
                  or
        msimple

  where:
  <database filename> is the filename of the Domino database to be modified.
  If the database filename is not specified, the program will prompt for it.


- Under IBM i type:
    rundomcmd server(<server name>) cmd(call pgm(qntcsdk/msimple)
        parm(simple.nsf)) batch(*no)
  or
    rundomcmd server(<server name>) cmd(call pgm(qntcsdk/msimple))
        batch(*no)
NOTE:  This program searches for documents with the numeric field "NUMBER".  
In order to perform a valid test, you should run msimple against a 
database, like simple.nsf, that contains documents where this field 
is present.
