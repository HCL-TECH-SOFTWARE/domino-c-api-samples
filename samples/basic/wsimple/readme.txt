this file to the Domino or Notes data directory before running this program.

- Under Windows, or UNIX,
  type:
       wsimple
  at the system command prompt.
- Under IBM i type:
    rundomcmd server(<server name>) cmd(call pgm(qntcsdk/wsimple))
        batch(*no)


This program will create a note in the database simple.nsf
containing data of types text, number, text list, and time/date.


EXAMINING THE DOMINO DATABASE TO SEE THE CHANGED DOCUMENTS
----------------------------------------------------------
To see if wsimple worked correctly:

Open simple.nsf.

A new document will be displayed in the main view.  Open the document
and confirm that it contains data of types text, number, text list, and
time/date.
