IDENTIFY A TEST DATABASE:
-------------------------

Determine the name of a Domino database file, such as intro.nsf, that
resides in a local or remote Domino or Notes data directory.
intro will work with any valid Domino database file.


RUNNING intro:
-------------

The command line of intro is  -

    intro [server name - optional] <database filename>

where:

    [server name - optional] is the name of a server where the database
                         resides. 
                         Required for remote access, 
                         omit it for local access. 

    <database filename> is the filename of the Domino database to read


EXAMPLE:

Under Windows, or UNIX (AIX or Linux),
for local access type:

    intro  intro.nsf

for remote access type:

    intro  valid_server_name intro.nsf


Under IBM i,
for local access type:
    rundomcmd server(<server name>) cmd(call pgm(qntcsdk/intro)
    parm(intro.nsf)) batch(*no)
for remote access type:
    rundomcmd server(<server name>) cmd(call pgm(qntcsdk/intro)
    parm(valid_server_name intro.nsf)) batch(*no)
If the program runs correctly, it should display a message with the
HCL C API for Domino and Notes release number followed by:

    The database is local with path : test.nsf

    The title for the database, intro.nsf, is:

    API Test Database (intro)


EXAMINING THE DOMINO DATABASE TO CHECK THE RESULT:
--------------------------------------------------

To see if 'intro' worked correctly:

    Use Notes to open intro.nsf

    Choose File/Database/Properties...

    You should see the same database title as displayed by this sample.
