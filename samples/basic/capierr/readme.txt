PROGRAM
-------
CapiErr - C API functions called from a C++ module to retrieve C API error messages.


PURPOSE
-------
A HCL C API for Domino and Notes sample program that retrieves C API error
messages.

This program demonstrates how to call C API functions from a module written
in C++ using the Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC).


ENVIRONMENTS
------------
Windows (32-bit)
Windows (64-bit)


FILES
-----
capierr.c    - Defines the class behaviors for the application.

capierr.h    - Main header file for the CapiErr application.

capierr.rc   - Resource compiler file for this example.

resource.h   - Resource compiler header file.

capierr.ico  - An icon file for this example.

capierrd.cpp - Implementation file containing C API function calls.

capierrd.h   - Header file.

stdafx.cpp   - Source file that includes just the standard include files.

stdafx.h     - Header file for standard system include files.

capierr.dsp  - MSVC++ project file.

capierr.dsw  - MSVC++ workspace file.

mswin32.mak     - Make file for Windows 32-bit.

mswin64.mak     - Make file for Windows 64-bit.

readme.txt   - This file specifies what is needed to use this example.


Compiling CapiErr:
------------------

There are two different ways to compile CapiErr:

1 - At the command prompt enter, nmake -f mswin32.mak.
     For windows 64-bit, nmake -f mswin64.mak.

2 - Launch the MSVC++ IDE, properly configured to compile C API
    applications (please see Chapter 3-1 "Building 32-bit Windows
    Applications for details), and go to 'File - Open - Workspaces'
    and specify the file 'capierr.dsw'.  Then, from the 'Build' menu,
    choose 'Build CapiErr.exe'.


RUNNING CapiErr:
-----------------

- Under Windows type capierr at the command prompt in the
  program's build directory.  When the CapiErr main window appears.
  Choose Hex or Dec and enter a STATUS value - that may be retuned
  from a C API function - in the Error Code window and click
  the Error button.  The text associated with the status will appear
  in the dialog box.

   For example:
   1) Choose Hex
   2) Enter 103
   3) "File does not exist" will appear in the dialog box.
