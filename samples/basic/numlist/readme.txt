PROGRAM
-------
numlist - Creates a number list field.


PURPOSE
-------
This program demonstrates how to create a number list field.  It creates 
a new note in the target database and appends text fields FORM and 
PLAIN_TEXT to the new note. Appends a number list field NUMBER to the 
note with the following values:  1,3,9703.4,-7,0.11592. 


ENVIRONMENTS
------------
Windows (32-bit)
Windows (64-bit)
IBM AIX
Linux 64 bit
Linux for zSeries
MAC OS X
IBM i

RUNNING numlist
---------------
- Under Windows or UNIX (AIX, Linux ),
  type the following at the system command prompt:
  
       numlist <database filename>
                or
       numlist

  where <database filename> is the filename of the Domino database where
  the new document is created.  Use a target database that has a form
  named "SimpleDataForm" containing a text field named PLAIN_TEXT and a
  number list field named NUMBER.  The Number List Test database included
  with the API toolkit (file numlist.nsf) is appropriate.

  If the database filename is not specified, the program will prompt for it.

- Under IBM i type:

    rundomcmd server(<server name>) cmd(call pgm(qntcsdk/numlist)
        parm(numlist.nsf)) batch(*no)
  or
    rundomcmd server(<server name>) cmd(call pgm(qntcsdk/numlist))
        batch(*no)
CHECKING THE RESULTS
--------------------
From Notes, open the "Number List Test" database.
Open the document with text "Created by sample NUMLIST.". Verify the
NUMBER field contains the values {1,3,9703.4,-7,0.11592}.
