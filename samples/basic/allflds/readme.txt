RUNNING allflds
---------------
This sample program will run against the Domino database simple.nsf,
provided with the HCL C API for Domino and Notes toolkit.  You must copy 
this file to the Domino or Notes data directory before running this program.


- Under Windows, or UNIX (AIX and Linux),
  type:
       allflds
  at the system command prompt.
- Under IBM i type:
    rundomcmd server(<server name>) cmd(call pgm(qntcsdk/allflds))
        batch(*no)

The program should print output that looks like this:
