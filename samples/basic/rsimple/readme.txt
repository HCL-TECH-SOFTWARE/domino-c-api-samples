RUNNING rsimple:
----------------
This sample program is designed to run against the Domino database, 
simple.nsf, provided with the HCL C API for Domino and Notes toolkit.  
You must copy this file to the Domino or Notes data directory before
running this program.


- Under Windows, or UNIX (AIX and Linux)
  type the following at the system command prompt:
  
        rsimple simple.nsf
               or
        rsimple



EXAMPLE:

      rsimple  simple.nsf
- Under IBM i type:
    rundomcmd server(<server name>) cmd(call pgm(qntcsdk/rsimple)
        parm(simple.nsf)) batch(*no)
  or
    rundomcmd server(<server name>) cmd(call pgm(qntcsdk/rsimple))
        batch(*no)

If the program runs correctly, it should display something similar to the
following:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note ID is: 8FE.                                                     
PLAIN_TEXT field is: The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dogs.

CHECKING THE RESULTS
--------------------

To see if rsimple worked correctly:

Open simple.nsf.

Double click on the documents to open them and check to see if the values in
the respective fields agree with what Notes displays.  Then, to see if the
names of the fields displayed agree with Notes, use File/Document Properties
to see the names of the fields.
