PROGRAM
-------
notesmain - Introductory HCL C API for Domino and Notes program that
            uses NotesMain as the main entry point.  The program opens

IDENTIFY A TEST DATABASE:
-------------------------

Determine the name of a Domino database file, such as intro.nsf, that
resides in the Domino or Notes data directory on your system. notesmain
will work with any valid Domino database file.


RUNNING notesmain:
------------------

The command line of notesmain is  -

    notesmain [server name - optional] <database filename>

where:

    [server name - optional] is the name of a server where the database
                             resides.
                             Required for remote access,
                             omit it for local access.

    <database filename> is the filename of the Domino database to read


EXAMPLE:

Under Windows or UNIX (AIX or Linux),
for local access type:

    notesmain  intro.nsf

for remote access type:

    notesmain  valid_server_name intro.nsf


Under IBM i,
for local access type:
    rundomcmd server(<server name>) cmd(call pgm(qntcsdk/notesmain)
    parm(intro.nsf)) batch(*no)
for remote access type:
    rundomcmd server(<server name>) cmd(call pgm(qntcsdk/notesmain)
    parm(valid_server_name intro.nsf)) batch(*no)
If the program runs correctly, it should display a message with the
HCL C API for Domino and Notes release number followed by:

    The title for the database, intro.nsf, is:

    API Test Database (intro)

Program completed successfully


EXAMINING THE DOMINO DATABASE TO CHECK THE RESULT:
--------------------------------------------------

To see if 'notesmain' worked correctly:

    Use Notes to open intro.nsf

    Choose File/Database/Properties...

    You should see the same database title as displayed by this sample.
