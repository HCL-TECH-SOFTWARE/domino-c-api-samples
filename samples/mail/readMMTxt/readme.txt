PURPOSE
-------
This program shows how to use the MIME functions to extract the text part from the MIME messages(Multipurpose 
Internet Mail Extensions) in a NSF database.

This program first scans all the notes in the specified Dabase. For those messages which have multi
MIME part, it extract the text parts of the messages, both the plain text and also the html text, and output them

attachments even they are plain text.
