About this sample:
--------------------
- In order to test SECGetSignerInfoFromMail, you need to have an SMIME document in a Notes 
database. And then opens the document and calls the SECGetSignerInfoFromMail function.  
Be sure to provide a callback function in order to verify *pCert. 

- The two key areas that will take a little bit of research on your part is how to create or get
the SMIME document (an internet mail document with an x.509 certificate) and how to verify *pCert 
that is given to you in your callback function.  You may use the file SignedMail.nsf, which already has 
an SMIME message that you can use.  Or you can create an SMIME message yourself- you will need to 
create an Internet certificate and have Notes use MIME. Please refer to notes help documents.

- To run this sample, you can copy the file SignedMail.nsf from the notesdata directory, and then run 
command as mailcert SignedMail.nsf or you can just specify the detailed path of the SignedMail.nsf, such 
as mailcert c:\notesapi\notesdata\SignedMail.nsf.

Verify the result:
------------------
The sample runs successfully if you get result as below:
