PURPOSE
-------
This program shows how to create a MIME(Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) 
format message and send it to a specified mail address.

This program first creates a new MEMO note in the mail.box on server, then calls the MIME
functions to append the predefined buffers(including both the headers and the body part)
 to the note, at last it adds a recipient to the note. This memo created will be sent to 
the recipient mailbox by domino mail router.  

Please refer to the User Guide database, Chapter 10-2
"Domino Mail Architecture", "mail.box" section for more information on 
programmatic access to the mail.box file.  Please refer to the Domino 
Administration Help for more information regarding multiple mail box files.
