PROGRAM

sendAttMM - Sends a MIME message with an embedded bitmap using MIME functions


ENVIRONMENTS
------------
Windows (32-bit)

IBM i


PURPOSE
-------
This program shows how to create a MIME(Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) 
format message with inline attachment and send it to a specified mail address.

This program first creates a new MEMO note in the mail.box on server, then calls
 the MIME functions to append all needed items (RFC822 header and MIME Body Parts)
to it. At last, the program adds a recipient to the message, this message will be 
routed to the recipient.

Please refer to the User Guide database, Chapter 10-2
"Domino Mail Architecture", "mail.box" section for more information on 
programmatic access to the mail.box file.  Please refer to the Domino 
Administration Help for more information regarding multiple mail box files.
