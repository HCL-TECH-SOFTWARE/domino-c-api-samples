PROGRAM
----------------
statdemo

PURPOSE
--------------
This is a sample HCL Domino Server based add-in task.  It creates a status line
and sets its status.

This Domino Server Add-In program uses the HCL C API for Domino and Notes
statistics reporting routines to periodically query the HCL Domino Server
for statistics information. Then it updates a database (statdemo.nsf) with
the information gathered.

ENVIRONMENTS
------------------------
Windows (32-bit)
Windows (64-bit)
Linux (64-bit)
IBM i

OPERATING ENVIRONMENT REQUIREMENTS
----------------------------------------------------------------
The file statdemo.nsf, the database in which statdemo will create notes,
must reside in the Domino data directory.

RUNNING statdemo
--------------------------
Under Windows and Linux 64-bit

1) Make sure the HCL Domino Server software is installed on the
current machine and the HCL Domino Server data directory contains a
HCL Domino Server log file (log.nsf).
Either the existing log file may be used or a new one may be created from
the Domino and Notes Log template.

2) Start the HCL Domino Server software.

The command line for statdemo execution is  -

    statdemo

EXAMPLE
--------------
Under Windows, Linux  64-bit

           statdemo

- Under IBM i, add the Symbolic Link to the executable file:
