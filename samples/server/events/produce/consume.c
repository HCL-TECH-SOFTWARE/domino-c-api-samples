    FUNCTION:   AddInMain

    PURPOSE:    Standard entry for all HCL Domino Server add-in tasks

    ALGORITHM:
    1.  Allocate a queue named "TEST_EVENT_QUEUE" as the event queue
        for this program.  Do this by calling EventQueueAlloc().

    2.  Call EventRegisterEventRequest() to specify the type and severity
        of events that will be consumed by this program.
        
    3.  Within the AddInIdle() loop, call EventQueueGet() to read and remove
        events of the appropriate type and severity from the queue. 
        A return value of ERR_EVTQUEUE_EMPTY indicates that there were no
        events to be processed.  A return value of NOERROR indicates
        there was an event processed. In this case, a handle to event
        specific data is also returned.

        Now, act on the event.  This program simply logs a message
        that an event has been consumed.

    4.  Before exiting the program, call EventDeregisterEventRequest() 
        to discontinue notification of particular events, and then
        deallocate the queue by calling EventQueueFree().
