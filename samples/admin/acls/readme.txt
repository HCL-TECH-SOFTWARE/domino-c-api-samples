PROGRAM
-------
acls - Sample HCL C API for Domino and Notes Program:
       demonstrates the Access Control List routines.

PURPOSE
-------
This program first reads into memory the Access Control List (ACL)
of the database specified in the command line, and then creates
a role.  Then, the program manipulates the ACL of three users and
a group in the following sequence:

1. user 1 : This is the user specified on the command line.  He is added
            to the ACL with Manager access level, and is granted the
            newly added Role.

   user 2 : user 2 is added to the ACL with Author access level,
            his access level privilege is further refined so he will
            be unable to create documents and unable to delete
            documents.

   user 3 : user 3 is added to the ACL with Designer access level.

   The information from the Access Control List is then printed.

2. group 1: group 1 is added to the ACL with Designer access level.

   user 3 : user 3 is deleted from ACL with the assumption that he
            is a member of the newly added group.

   user 2 : user 2's ACL is modified to Editor access level, and
            his access level privilege is refined, so he will be
            unable to delete documents.

   default user: default user's access level is modified to Reader.

   The information from the Access Control List is then printed
   again.

3. ACLLookupAccess is then demonstrated, for the first user (the
   manager) and user 3 who belongs to a group specified in the ACL.

4. The ACL is stored in the database.

RUNNING acls:
-------------
This sample program will run against the Domino database acls.nsf,
provided with the HCL C API for Domino and Notes toolkit.
You must copy this file to the Domino data directory before 
running this program.


- Under UNIX (AIX, Linux ) , Windows type the following
  at the system command prompt:

  acls <database> <ManagerName>

  where:

  <database>    is the database to operate on.
  <ManagerName> is the name of the Manager to be added to the ACL.  This
                name is likely to have spaces so put it in quotation marks.

  for example:

  acls acls "Dee Manager"
- Under IBM i:
  run:  rundomcmd server(<server>) cmd(call pgm(qntcsdk/acls)
	        parm(acls.nsf 'Dee Manager')) batch(*no)


EXAMPLE:
--------
If you use acls.nsf for the database and Dee Manager for the Manager Name,
the program will print the following to the screen:

*** "Dee Manager" ACL info from ACLLookupAccess function ***

Dee Manager has the following access:
      Access Level:  Manager
      Roles: [Marketing]


*** "Jayne Doe" ACL info from ACLLookupAccess function ***

Jayne Doe has the following access:
      Access Level:  Designer
