PROGRAM
-------
activity -  A HCL C API for Domino and Notes program that reads the binary records from 
	    the server's log file and displays it to standard output. Activity 
	    logging replaces and surpasses the previous Billing functionality. The 
	    activity logging services are a set of routines that read and write binary 
	    records to the server log (log.nsf). For efficiency, many records are written 
	    to one note. 

	    ** IMPORTANT NOTE ** Activity logging MUST be enabled in order
	    retrieve the contents of the binary records using the Activity Logging API.
	    Please refer to the Domino documentation for a complete description of
	    activity logging.

RUNNING activity:
------------------

The command line of activity is  -

    activity <servername>

EXAMPLE:

Under Windows or UNIX (AIX or Linux), type:

    activity  "domino server"

- Under IBM i, type:
      rundomcmd server(<server>) cmd(call pgm(qntcsdk/activity))
	        batch(*no)


If the program runs correctly, it should display a message with the following similar output:
