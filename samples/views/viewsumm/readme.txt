RUNNING viewsumm
----------------
This sample program can be run against the Domino database summary.nsf,
provided with the HCL C API for Domino and Notes toolkit.  Copy this file
to the Domino or Notes data directory before running this program.

- Under Windows or UNIX (AIX, Linux),
  type the following at the system command prompt:

        viewsumm <database filename> <view name in quotes>
                 or
        viewsumm

  where:

  <database filename> is the filename of the Domino database.
  <view name> is the name of the view.  If no command line arguments 
  are provided, the program will prompt for them.

If entering arguments at the prompts instead of at the command line, 
  do not enclose your responses in quotation marks.


EXAMPLE:

      viewsumm  summary  "FlatView"

- Under IBM i type:

    rundomcmd server(<server name>) cmd(call pgm(qntcsdk/viewsumm)) 
		batch(*no)

  or 

    rundomcmd server(<server name>) cmd(call pgm(qntcsdk/viewsumm)
		parm(summary.nsf FlatView)) batch(*no)
Upon executing this command, viewsumm will print out the summary
information for each note in the view, FlatView. If an item in the 
summary information is an "empty" item, then a "*" will be printed for 
that item.  An "empty" item is an item that has zero length.
