RUNNING navigate:
-----------------
Copy the sample database, "hierarch.nsf", to the Domino Data directory on
your system.  From the Notes user interface, add the database's icon to your
Notes workspace.

- Under Windows: type the following at the system command prompt:

    navigate <database> <view>

    where:
      <database> is the filename of the Domino database to operate on
      <view> is the name of the view to navigate


EXAMPLE:

      NAVIGATE  hierarch twolevels

If the program runs correctly, it should display

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note ID number 1 is: 211A
Note ID number 2 is: 211E
Note ID number 3 is: 2122

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Under IBM i:
  run:  rundomcmd server(<server>) cmd(call pgm(qntcsdk/navigate) 
          parm('hierarch' 'twolevels' )) batch(*no)  

EXAMINING THE DOMINO DATABASE TO CHECK THE RESULT:
--------------------------------------------------

To see if NAVIGATE worked correctly:

Open HIERARCH.NSF.

Go to the documents in Main B, sequence 2. For each one, choose
File/Document Properties... item, select the Document IDs tab
(sixth tab from the left) of the document's properties InfoBox and
look at the last line of the ID value.  It should end with one
of the NoteIDs that were in the output.
