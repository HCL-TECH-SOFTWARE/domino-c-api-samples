- Under Windows or UNIX (AIX, or Linux) type:

       viewids

  at the system command prompt.


- Under IBM i type:

    rundomcmd server(<server name>) cmd(call pgm(qntcsdk/viewids))
        batch(*no)
The viewids sample will print out a count and the note ID for each note in the 
view "SimpleDataView".
