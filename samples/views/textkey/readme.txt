RUNNING textkey:
----------------
Copy the sample database, "textkey.nsf", to the Domino Data directory on
your system.  From the Notes user interface, add the database's icon to your
Notes workspace.

- Under Windows: type the following at the system command prompt:

    textkey <database> <view> <string>

    where:
      <database> is the filename of the Domino database to operate on
      <view> is the name of the view to search
      <string> is the text to look for in the view


EXAMPLE:

      TEXTKEY  TEXTKEY PeopleView "Smith, Carl"

If the program runs correctly, it should display:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note count is 1.         Note ID is: 2112

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Under IBM i:
  run:   rundomcmd server(<server>) cmd(call pgm(qntcsdk/textkey) 
            parm('textkey.nsf' 'PeopleView' 'Smith, Carl' )) batch(*no)       

EXAMINING THE DOMINO DATABASE TO CHECK THE RESULT:
--------------------------------------------------

To see if TEXTKEY worked correctly:

Open TEXTKEY.NSF.

In the menu, for each document that has the name "Smith, Carl", choose
File/Document Properties.Select the Document IDs tab of the document's
properties InfoBox and look at the last line of the ID value.
It should end with one of the NoteIDs that was in the output.
