RUNNING idvault:
------------------------
Before running this program, please create an ID vault on Domino Server.
(Detail information please see "Creating and configuring an ID vault" section in Domino Administrator help documents)

Also create four users whose last names(equals short name) are s1, s2, s3, ss, whose password should be "123456".

The id file names should be  "s1.id","s2.id","s3.id","ss.id".
Then save these id files to domino data directory. 

In Domino Administrator select each user from "People" and select "Edit Person". Now goto "Administration" tab,
in "Policy Management" for "Assigned policy" select the idvault created and then Save & Close.

Refresh the Domino Administrator after making changes to each user since it takes time to accept the changes.
Otherwise, we may get "Entry not found in index" during execution.

- Under Windows or Linux
  at the system command prompt:

  idvault <server name> <domain>

Note: Provide full path for id file in code incase of error like Illegal use of noteid.
Note: For Windows 32 bit execution make sure admin.id is already uploaded to idvault along with above steps.

EXAMPLE:
--------------
      idvault "CN=LGCToolkit/O=toolkit" "toolkit"

- Under IBM i, type  

        RUNDOMCMD SERVER(<servername>) CMD(CALL PGM(QNTCSDK/IDVAULT) PARM('server name' 'domain name'))

CHECKING THE RESULTS
------------------------------------
Open idvault db.

You can find "s1.id","s2.id","s3.id" document in this db.

SAMPLE OUTPUT
