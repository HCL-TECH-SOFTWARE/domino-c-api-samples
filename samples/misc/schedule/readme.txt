PROGRAM

schedule - Allows the user to add appointments, meeting invitations,
           delete the scheduled events or get the busy/free time
           information from their schedule.

           process, this sample only demonstrate the procedure of
           creating a meeting invitation, without sending the notice
           to the invitees.

RUNNING schedule:
-----------------

Note: Entering a date/time in the past is not supported by the API and
      may return inaccurate results.

- Under Windows, type
  the following at the system command prompt:

  schedule <command> <server> <mail file> <start time> <end time>
             or
  schedule
  
- Under IBM i, type
    RUNDOMCMD SERVER(<servername>) CMD(CALL PGM(QNTCSDK/SCHEDULE)
    PARM(<command> <server> <mail file> <start time> <end time>))
    BATCH(*NO)
        or
    RUNDOMCMD SERVER(<servername>) CMD(CALL PGM(QNTCSDK/SCHEDULE)) 
    BATCH(*NO)

  where:
        <command>    is one of the following schedule command to perform
                        add-i : add an invitation
                        add-a : add an appointment
                        del   : delete a schedule
                        busy  : check busy schedule
        <server>     is the server name the user's mail database is on
                     (ex. zathras).
        <mail file>  is the mail file name of the user (ex. mail\jdoe.nsf)
        <start time> is the start time of the range of time that you are
                     interested in (ex. 08/16/2005 02:00 pm")
                     Note: you must enter any single digit date/time
                     with a leading zero.
        <end time>   is the end time of the range of time that you are
                     interested in (ex. 08/16/2005 05:00 pm")
                     Note: you must enter any single digit date/time
                     with a leading zero.

  If no command line arguments are provided, the program will prompt for
  them.
