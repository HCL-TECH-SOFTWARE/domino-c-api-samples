EXAMPLE
-------

The sample database, simple.nsf, has the following view:
    SimpleDataView

  itemmisc simple.nsf SimpleDataView 


If the program runs correctly, it should display:

 Note id [0x8f6] has reader field.
 Before Modifying Item's value: This is a line of simple text.
 NSFItemRealloc returned successfully.
 ITEM Value is modified successfully and values are equal.
 Modified Item's value: This is a line of modified simple text.

 Note id [0x8fa] has no reader field.
 Copied doc [0x8f6] modified Item value to doc [0x8fa],
 Value of item is: [This is a line of modified simple text.] Item Name: [plainText].

 Modified item [plainText] value using NSFItemSetTextSummary flag[0],
 Item value type[1280], Length [34], Item value [This is summary value modification]

CHECKING THE RESULTS
