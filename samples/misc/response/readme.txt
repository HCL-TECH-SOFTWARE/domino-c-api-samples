RUNNING response:
--------------------------
Copy the sample database, "response.nsf", to the Domino or the Notes
data directory on your system.  From the Notes user interface, add 
the database's icon to your Notes workspace.

Note:
-----
Before running this sample, make sure that the variable "UserName" in the file response.c
is changed to the Domino Administrator user name. The first time you run the sample,
make sure that response.nsf is open in the Notes client.

- Under Windows or UNIX (AIX, Linux ),
  type the following at the system command prompt:
 
    response <database filename> <subject text>
	     or
    response
 
    where:
      <database filename> is the filename of the Domino database.
      <subject text> is the subject text string.  

    If no command line arguments are provided, the program will prompt for
    them.

    If entering arguments at the prompts instead of at the command line, do
    not enclose them in quotation marks.


EXAMPLE
--------------
Under Windows or UNIX:

    response response "How do you do?"

- Under IBM i, type:

	rundomcmd server(<server name>) cmd(call pgm(qntcsdk/response)
	parm(response.nsf 'How are you?')) batch(*no)

SAMPLE OUTPUT
-------------------------

Testing NIFUpdateFilter:
------------------------
Total unread documents in the database: 3.
Deleted an entry in the id table.
Total unread documents after using NIFUpdateFilters: 2.

NIFUpdateFilters was successful.

Response documents:
--------------
How do you do?    
A response to: How do you do?        
Another response to: A response to: How do you do?        

Program completed successfully.
