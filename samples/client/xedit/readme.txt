INSTALLING AND RUNNING xedit
----------------------------
To install xedit, copy the executable program library to the Notes program
directory. The actual name of the DLL depends on the platform:

  Windows:  nxedit.dll

Modify your notes.ini file by adding a line for this edit-level export DLL.
This reference takes the form

  EDITEXPxx=<parameter list>,

where xx is a number that starts at 1 and is incremented for each
successive DLL reference.  The reference that must be added for
_XEDIT.DLL appears below.  The title string "Sample ASCII Export" will
appear in the export File Dialog box as the label for this export DLL.

NOTE: Make sure to change the "xx" in "EDITEXPxx" to be one more than
that of the last EDITEXP reference.

Restart Notes so the changes to the notes.ini file take effect.  Open a
database and open a document to be exported.  Then, from the Notes menu,
choose File, then choose Export to display the File export dialog box.
Choose the subdirectory to which the file should be exported, type in
the filename under which to store the file, and choose "Sample ASCII
export" from the listbox on the right.  The note will be exported to a
file in the specified name and subdirectory, using the _XEDIT export DLL.
