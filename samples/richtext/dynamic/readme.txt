PROGRAM
-------
dynamic - Fill a RichText Field


PURPOSE
-------
This program shows how to create a rich text field by dynamically 
allocating a buffer, filling the buffer with CD records converted to 
Domino canonical format, and appending the buffer to a note as a 
rich-text field.


ENVIRONMENTS
------------
Windows (32-bit)
Windows (64-bit)
IBM AIX
Linux 64 bit
MAC OS X
IBM i

RUNNING dynamic
---------------
This program opens the Domino database richtext.nsf. The C API kit provides
this database in the notedata directory. You must copy this file to the 
Domino or Notes data directory before running dynamic.

- Under Windows, or UNIX (AIX, Linux ),
  type the following at the system command prompt:

        dynamic

  The program takes no arguments.

- Under IBM i type:

    rundomcmd server(<server name>) cmd(call pgm(qntcsdk/dynamic))
        batch(*no)


CHECKING THE RESULTS
--------------------
Open the target database using Notes.

Double-click on the newly created document in order to read it. 
The text should say:

"Hello World...   So long world".
