RUNNING mktable
---------------
- Under Windows, or UNIX (AIX, Linux ),
  type the following at the system command prompt:

       mktable [<database>]

where:

  <database> is the filename of the Domino database to operate on.
  If this argument is omitted, the program will prompt for it.
  For testing, you should use the "Test of Tables" database, tabletst.nsf,
  included with the HCL C API for Domino and Notes toolkit.

EXAMPLE
-------

  mktable tabletst
- Under IBM i type:

    rundomcmd server(<server name>) cmd(call pgm(qntcsdk/mktable)
        parm(tabletst.nsf)) batch(*no)


CHECKING THE RESULTS
--------------------
To see if mktable worked correctly:

  Open the Test of Tables database (tabletst.nsf).

  Open the newly created document.  You should see a brief paragraph
  followed by three different tables.
