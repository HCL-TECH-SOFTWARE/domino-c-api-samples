RUNNING fontbl
--------------
- First copy the database richtext.nsf located in the Notedata directory
  to the Domino or Notes data directory.

- Under Windows, or UNIX (AIX, Linux ),
  type the following at the system command prompt:

        fontbl <database filename>
            or
        fontbl

where:

   <database filename>  is the filename of the Domino database.
   If no command line argument is provided, the program will prompt
   for it.

EXAMPLE
-------

        fontbl  richtext

- Under IBM i, type:

    rundomcmd server(<server name>) cmd(call pgm(qntcsdk/fontbl)
    parm(richtext.nsf) batch(*no)
   

CHECKING THE RESULTS
--------------------
FONTBL  will create a document in the database richtext.nsf.  The
document's RICH_TEXT field will contain three lines of richtext, 
each line in a different font.

After running the FONTBL program, open the database and display the
document that was just created.  The RICH_TEXT field will contain the
strings: 

"This is an example of System Monospaced font."
"This is an example of System Proportional font."
"This is an example of TYPEWRITER font."

The first line will be displayed in blue System Monospaced font.
The second line will be displayed in magenta System Proportional font.
The third line will be displayed in black TYPEWRITER (Courier) font.

Note that the TYPEWRITER font is not defined in the font table.  It is
one of the three hard coded fonts supported.
