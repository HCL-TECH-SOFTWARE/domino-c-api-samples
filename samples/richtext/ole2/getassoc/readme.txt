RUNNING getassoc
----------------
This program shows how to get associated files from an OLE 2 object
embedded in documents in the Domino database "embedole.nsf".

Make sure the Domino database "embedole.nsf" resides in the Domino or
Notes data directory.

Through the Notes User Interface, create a document in this database and
insert an OLE 2 object.  Name the OLE 2 object "OLEobject".

   To name an OLE object in Notes:

      - click on the object in the document to select it.
      - select the object's menu pick, then Object Properties.
      - in the infobox, enter OLEobject for Name.
      - close the infobox, close and save the document.

   To associate a file with the OLE object in Notes:

      - click on the object in the document to select it.
      - select the object's menu pick, then Associate file to object
      - in the dialog box, enter the file specification to a file
      - enter the attachment name
      - close the dialog box, close and save the document.

   The Notes API test program OLEASSOC can also be used to associated
   a file.

GETASSOC will get all $FILE attachments from the embedded OLE 2
object named "OLEobject" in the document in the database embedole.nsf.

- Under Windows
  type:
       getassoc
  at the system command prompt.


CHECKING THE RESULTS
--------------------
Open embedole.nsf database in Notes.  Open the document.  Select the OLE
object by clicking on it.  In the object's menu select Object properties.
In the infobox select the "folder" panel which will list the associated
files.  Compare this list with what was gotten.
