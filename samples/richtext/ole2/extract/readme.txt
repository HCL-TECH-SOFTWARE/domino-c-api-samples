RUNNING extract
---------------
This program shows how to extract OLE 2 object(s) embedded in documents in
the Domino database "embedole.nsf" to structured storage file(s).

Make sure the Domino database "embedole.nsf" resides in the Domino or
Notes data directory.

Through the Notes User Interface, create a document in this database and
insert an OLE 2 object.

EXTRACT will create structured storage files whose name corresponds
to the name extendable $FILE object of embedded OLE 2 objects (e.g.
EXT12345.OLE) in the database embedole.nsf.

- Under Windows,
  type:

       extract

  at the system command prompt.


CHECKING THE RESULTS
--------------------
Open the structured storage file(s) with the DocFile Viewer application
that ships with the Microsoft Developer Tools.  The extracted object will
be in a substorage named for the ProgID of the extracted object.
