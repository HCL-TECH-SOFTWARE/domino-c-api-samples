RUNNING rrich
-------------
The command line of rrich is:

  rrich <database>

where:

  <database> is the filename of the Domino database to operate on


EXAMPLE
-------

  rrich richtext

- Under IBM i type:

    rundomcmd server(<server name>) cmd(call pgm(qntcsdk/rrich)
        parm(richtext.nsf)) batch(*no)
If the program runs correctly, it should display something that looks like:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

       ************* Note ID is: 212A. *************

RICH_TEXT field is:

This is some rich text.
This is a centered paragraph
It will be used  to demonstrate  the HCL C API for Domino and Notes
CompoundText Routines.

These lines use font faces that require a font table (a
$Fonts item).
1234 asdfjkl;
(MS Sans Serf, Symbol, and System)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


CHECKING THE RESULTS
--------------------
To see if rrich worked correctly, open Rich Text Test database (richtext.nsf).
Open the documents. The text should be the same as displayed on the screen.
It will have different colors, sizes, alignment, and styles, but it will
be the same text as that displayed.
